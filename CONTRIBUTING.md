### üîß Contributing Code

We welcome code contributions! Here are the types of contributions we're looking for:

#### üéØ Priority Areas

- **AI Storytelling**: Improve story generation and personalization
- **Performance**: Optimize app performance and reduce bundle size

- **Refactoring**: Improve code quality and structure
- **Performance improvements**: Make the app faster
- **UI/UX improvements**: Enhance the user experience

## üîÑ Development Process

### Branch Strategy

We use **GitHub Flow** with the following conventions:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `feature/feature-name`: New features
- `bugfix/issue-description`: Bug fixes
- `chore/task-description`: Maintenance tasks
- `docs/documentation-update`: Documentation updates

### Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** with clear, focused commits

3. **Write or update tests** for your changes

4. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** using conventional commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add AI story personalization"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve GPS accuracy issue"
   git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** using our [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

## üìù Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Code Style

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow the existing **ESLint** and **Prettier** configuration
- Use **meaningful variable and function names**
- Add **JSDoc comments** for public APIs
- Prefer **functional components** and **hooks**

```typescript
// Good
interface TrailLocation {
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  elevation?: number;
}

const getTrailDistance = (start: TrailLocation, end: TrailLocation): number => {
  // Implementation here
};

// Bad
const calc = (a: any, b: any) => {
  // Implementation here
};
```

### React Native Conventions

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Follow **React Native best practices**
- Use **TypeScript interfaces** for props
- Implement **proper error boundaries**
- Use **memo** for performance optimization when needed

```typescript
// Good
interface TrailCardProps {
  trail: Trail;
  onPress: (trail: Trail) => void;
  isLoading?: boolean;
}

const TrailCard: React.FC<TrailCardProps> = ({ trail, onPress, isLoading = false }) => {
  // Component implementation
};

export default memo(TrailCard);
```

### File and Directory Organization

- Use **kebab-case** for file names: `trail-card.component.tsx`
- Use **PascalCase** for component files: `TrailCard.tsx`
- Group related files in directories
- Use **barrel exports** (`index.ts`) for clean imports

```
src/components/trails/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TrailCard.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TrailList.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TrailSearch.tsx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
```

### Git Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` formatting changes
- `refactor:` code refactoring
- `test:` adding or updating tests
- `chore:` maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(ai): add story personalization based on user interests
fix(maps): resolve GPS accuracy issue on Android devices
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## üß™ Testing

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

- **Unit tests** for utilities and services
- **Integration tests** for complex workflows
- **Component tests** for React components
- **E2E tests** for critical user flows (when applicable)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test TrailService.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

### Writing Tests

Use **Jest** and **React Native Testing Library**:

```typescript
// Good test example
import { render, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import { TrailCard } from '../TrailCard';
import { mockTrail } from '../../__mocks__/trail.mock';

describe('TrailCard', () => {
  it('should call onPress when card is tapped', async () => {
    const mockOnPress = jest.fn();
    const { getByTestId } = render(
      <TrailCard trail={mockTrail} onPress={mockOnPress} />
    );

    fireEvent.press(getByTestId('trail-card'));
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(mockOnPress).toHaveBeenCalledWith(mockTrail);
    });
  });
});
```

## üì§ Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fill out the PR template** completely
2. **Link related issues** using GitHub keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123")
3. **Request review** from relevant maintainers
4. **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
5. **Ensure CI passes** (tests, linting, type checking)

### PR Review Criteria

Your PR will be reviewed for:

- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Code Quality**: Is it well-written and maintainable?
- **Testing**: Are there adequate tests?
- **Documentation**: Is documentation updated if needed?
- **Performance**: Does it maintain or improve performance?
- **Security**: Are there any security concerns?

### After Your PR is Merged

1. **Delete your feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
   git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Update your main branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```
