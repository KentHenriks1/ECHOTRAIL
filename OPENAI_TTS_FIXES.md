# 🔧 OpenAI TTS Stack Overflow Fixes Applied

## 🚨 **Problem**
The app was experiencing "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors during OpenAI TTS audio playback, causing fallback to lower-quality system TTS voices instead of high-quality OpenAI voices (like Nova).

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Recursive Loop**: `textToSpeechWithCache()` was calling `textToSpeech()`, which then called `textToSpeechWithCache()` again, creating an infinite recursion
2. **ArrayBuffer to Base64 Conversion**: Large audio buffers (>100KB) were causing stack overflow when converting to base64 using spread operator (`...new Uint8Array(buffer)`)

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Eliminated Recursive Calls**
- **Before**: `textToSpeechWithCache` → `textToSpeech` → `textToSpeechWithCache` (infinite loop)
- **After**: `textToSpeechWithCache` → `textToSpeechDirect` (direct API call, no recursion)

**Changes:**
- Renamed original `textToSpeech()` to `textToSpeechDirect()` (private method)
- Made `textToSpeech()` a simple wrapper that calls `textToSpeechWithCache()`
- Updated cache logic to call `textToSpeechDirect()` instead of `textToSpeech()`

### 2. **Fixed Base64 Conversion Stack Overflow**
- **Before**: `btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(buffer)))` - caused stack overflow for large buffers
- **After**: Chunked conversion for buffers >100KB to prevent stack overflow

**Implementation:**
```typescript
if (uint8Array.length > 100000) { // > 100KB, use chunked conversion
  const chunkSize = 8192; // 8KB chunks
  let binaryString = '';
  
  for (let i = 0; i < uint8Array.length; i += chunkSize) {
    const chunk = uint8Array.subarray(i, Math.min(i + chunkSize, uint8Array.length));
    binaryString += String.fromCharCode.apply(null, Array.from(chunk));
  }
  base64Audio = btoa(binaryString);
} else {
  // Small buffer, use direct conversion
  base64Audio = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...uint8Array));
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
- Added detailed logging throughout `playAudioBuffer()` to track buffer sizes and conversion progress
- Added playback status logging to help diagnose future audio issues

## 🧪 **Verification**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Chunked base64 conversion works for large buffers (200KB tested)
- ✅ Small buffer conversion still works efficiently
- ✅ No recursive calls in the service structure
- ✅ All tests pass in mock environment

## 🎯 **Expected Results**
1. **No More Stack Overflows**: App should handle OpenAI TTS audio playback without "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors
2. **High-Quality TTS**: Norwegian text should now use high-quality OpenAI voices (Nova, Shimmer, etc.) instead of falling back to system TTS
3. **Better Performance**: Chunked conversion prevents browser/runtime freezing on large audio files
4. **Improved Debugging**: Detailed logs help identify any remaining audio issues

## 📝 **Files Modified**
- `src/services/OpenAITTSService.ts` - Main service with recursion and conversion fixes

## 🔄 **Next Steps**
1. Test in the actual React Native app with real OpenAI TTS
2. Monitor logs for any remaining audio issues
3. Verify Norwegian text pronunciation quality with Nova voice
4. Consider adding progress indicators for large audio file processing

## 🚀 **Usage**
The service now properly handles:
- API key users: Real OpenAI TTS with caching
- Non-API users: Fallback to system TTS
- Large audio files: Chunked processing prevents stack overflow
- Error handling: Graceful fallback on any audio issues

The stack overflow issue should now be resolved, allowing the app to consistently deliver high-quality OpenAI TTS voices for Norwegian content.
